# salted_password
Create a function in Python named salted_password.  The function should take in two parameters:
- Password Chosen By User
- Salt - This is normally generated by this code but for this exercise it will be passed to your function: os.urandom(32).hex()

Your function should append the Salt to the password and hash with the SHA256 function from the hashlib Python module and return the result.

Your source code should be named password.py
